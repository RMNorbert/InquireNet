## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the InquireNet project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

To set up the project, follow these steps:
    
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before proceeding with the installation:

#### 1.   Java Development Kit (JDK):
   Ensure that you have the Java Development Kit installed on your machine. You can download the JDK from the Oracle website and install it according to the provided instructions.

#### 2.    Spring Boot: 
   Install Spring Boot, which is the framework used for building the application. You can find the necessary resources and installation instructions on the official Spring Boot website. Choose the appropriate version for your project and follow the installation guide.

#### 3.    JDBC Database (e.g., PostgreSQL):
   In order to use a JDBC database with the application, such as PostgreSQL, make sure you have the necessary database server installed on your system. You can download and install PostgreSQL from the official PostgreSQL website and configure it as required.

### Installation

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the InquireNet project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Configure the project:**
    Once you have cloned the repository, you need to configure the project by providing the necessary environment variables and database connection details. This includes setting up the database connection URL, username, and password, as well as any other environment-specific configuration values. Make sure to update the configuration files (application.properties, .env) with the appropriate values.

3. **Build and run the project:**
    InquireNet can be built and run using your preferred development environment or command-line tools. Here are a few options:

     Using Maven: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project's root directory, and run the following command:
